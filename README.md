Photoshop-Export-Layers-as-Images
=================================

<b>This light-weight script allows you to export your layers as individual JPGs / PNGs at a speed much faster than the built-in script from Adobe. Due note, that it does not contain all the functionality the Adobe one has, but it is due to its barebones nature that it is faster. Feel free to contribute to it and make it even more powerful!</b>

This script was originally built as a response to a question on [graphicdesign.stackexchange.com](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/).

The question may be found [here](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/1961/408).

As well as [my answer](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/1962/408).
